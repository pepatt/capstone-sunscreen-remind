# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

An app that tracks and reminds you to apply sunscreen in the morning

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Skin health is important not only for asthetic reasons and to indicate status but neglecting sunscreen can potentially lead to cancer. Some people are more prone than others to get skin cancer it all depends on the genetics. The goal is to make sunscreen application trivial and to eliviate the stress of having to keep track of your habits over weeks months or hopefully years.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

People who are likely to get skin cancer from UV light are my main concern with this project, most traffic on the app will be seen in the early morning and occasionally I expect users to log on to see if people in their close circle are also keeping up or to get educated on other health related information.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

Need to implement a button for the user to press after they have applied sunscreen for the day, the app should notify the user when to expect lots of sunlight and when their skin will be at risk this would be done through using weather API but it will not display any weather statistics the app should feel like a companion and signal to the user in a human friendly kind of way ex: "Expect to see lots of sunlight, use of sunscreen is highly advised", "Expect some sunlight, sunscreen is moderately advised", "Expect to see little to no sunlight today, sunscreen application may be optional today".

The app should store in a database the dates and times of day when the user applied sunscreen

I want the user to login using some essential information like name/email, password, place of residence (so I can pull relavent weather data), skintone (further reaserch is required). A user profile system will be necessary to implement peer to peer interaction. A way for users to add contacts who have also signed up will be made so that users can see who is keeping up the habit of applying their sunscreen on time and when the weather calls for it.

A calendar should be implemented which seamlessly shows the user the weather from when they made an account till the day they decide to use this feature. The showing of information should be simple and all visual hopefully no words will be used as I want the user to know a lot from just taking a glace at the calendar. In addition to the log of weather trends in the past I the app to show when the user has applied sunscreen in the past. A nice to have would be to show the severity of a missed application, say the user didn't use sunscreen on a really sunny day vs a rainy day visually this difference should be shown to the user.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out.

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.
